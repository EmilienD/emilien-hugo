This site answers a few questions about me. Not that anyone ever stopped me in the street to ask me those but since
you're here, I thought you might be
interested.

### "But who are you?"

A deeply philosophical question if you really think about it, but let's keep it casual until we know each other
better.

My name is Emilien Durieu, I'm a 29-year-old nerd who enjoys programming either to make people's life easier,
or more fun.
I'm fluent in French, English and Javascript.
What I enjoy most in my work is building high tech web apps.
I like good food, travelling and oh wait this isn't Tinder, sorry.

Anyway if you wanna get in touch, don't hesitate to send me an email
to [hello@emilienduri.eu](mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=I%20have%20a%20problem%20that%20I%20think%20can%20be%20solved%20by%20a%20programmer).
Maybe we can also go for a beer or something sometimes.

### "I'm looking for a developer for my company/startup/project, are you interested?"

I am very interested, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=Looking%20for%20a%20dev)!
I'm a full stack developer with experience in a team setting as well as building entire projects on my own.
My strong suits are React, NodeJS and PostgreSQL, and I have some experience with VueJS, Rust and MongoDB.

### "I need a website, can you help?"

I certainly can! If you need a webshop or a blog, or even a simple website for your business or association, I
can set everything up for you. [Just ask!](mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=Put%20me%20on%20the%20Internet)

### "What else can you do for me?"

I cook a terrific chili sin carne that makes delicious burritos, but I guess that's not what you mean.

If you have any task that is very repetitive, there's a good chance I can help you automate it.
For example if you're using excel for some processes and are tired of it or reaching its limits, [send me an email](mailto:hello@emilienduri.eu?subject=Bloody%20Exc-hell) and let's talk about it.
